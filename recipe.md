# CREAMY MUSHROOMS PENNE PASTA
This makes a lovely healthy mid week dinner, its easy to make and is super satisfying. Try to use wholemeal pasta as itâ€™s high in fibre and release its sugars slower when compared to white pasta. We use penne but you could use your favourite pasta. Brown rice pasta is our favourite gluten free pasta

### INSTRUCTIONS
 
1. *To toast raw cashew nuts just heat a non stick pan on medium heat, add the cashew nuts and keep them moving till they start to brown. This should take between 5-6 mins, be careful not to burn the nuts.
2. Peel and finely chop the onions and garlic, chop the mushrooms and broccoli into small pieces. Fill and boil the kettle. Cook the pasta as per the instructions on the back of the pack adding the broccoli to the pasta so it cooks at the same time, the broccoli should only take 3-4 mins to cook. Keep a cup of pasta water to thin the sauce out later.
Drain and rinse in cold water once cooked to stop further cooking.
3. Put a non stick frying pan on high heat and allow the pan to get super hot. Once super hot add the onions and garlic and fry until they start to brown.
4. Once they start to brown and stick a little add some veg stock (approx 1 tsp) or water to clean the pan and incorporate the browned flavour to the dish. This should take about 3-5 mins.
5. Add the mushrooms and fry for 3-4 mins again adding a little water or veg stock if they start to stick. You want to ensure you are frying rather than boiling (frying there is little or no liquid or water in the pan vrs boiling the veg is submerged under water.) Add 3 tbsp of tamari/ soy sauce and fry for a further 2 mins. Turn off the heat and remove the mushrooms and set aside.
6. Time to make the sauce, in a blender add the cashew nuts, soy milk or milk of choice, lemon, salt and garlic powder and blend till super smooth.
7. Put the frying pan back on high heat, add the sauce and heat up and allow the sauce to reduce & thicken for 2-3 mins. Add the cooked pasta and broccoli straight into the sauce.
8. If the sauce gets too thick add a little pasta water to reach the desired thickness of sauce. Taste and season to your liking.
9. Chop the chilli (removing seeds if you want it less hot) and pluck the thyme off the stalk and serve to add flavour and garnish
enjoy.
